Risk Summary:
The application has several security vulnerabilities related to SQL injection and template injection. These issues could potentially allow an attacker to steal or modify sensitive data, execute arbitrary SQL commands, or inject malicious code into the application's output. Additionally, the debug flag is enabled, which could leak sensitive information to attackers.

Remediation Steps:
1. Use parameterized queries instead of manually constructing SQL strings. This can be achieved using Django's QuerySets or SQLAlchemy's ORM.
2. Avoid using string formatting to create templates. Instead, use a templating engine that supports secure template rendering, such as Jinja2.
3. Disable the debug flag in production environments. This can be done by setting the 'debug' variable to False in the Flask configuration or by using system environment variables.
4. Regularly test the application for SQL injection and template injection vulnerabilities using tools like Semgrep or OWASP ZAP.
5. Implement input validation and sanitization to prevent malicious input from being executed or displayed in the application.
