- LLM-applied fixes: **13**

## Findings
- **python.flask.security.audit.render-template-string.render-template-string** in `/tmp/mcp_semgrep_tk_qkny0/repo/app_vuln.py`: Found a template created with string formatting. This is susceptible to server-side template injection and cross-site scripting attacks.
- **python.django.security.injection.tainted-sql-string.tainted-sql-string** in `/tmp/mcp_semgrep_tk_qkny0/repo/app_vuln.py`: Detected user input used to manually construct a SQL string. This is usually bad practice because manual construction could accidentally result in a SQL injection. An attacker could use a SQL injection to steal or modify contents of the database. Instead, use a parameterized query which is available by default in most database engines. Alternatively, consider using the Django object-relational mappers (ORM) instead of raw SQL queries.

- **python.sqlalchemy.security.sqlalchemy-execute-raw-query.sqlalchemy-execute-raw-query** in `/tmp/mcp_semgrep_tk_qkny0/repo/app_vuln.py`: Avoiding SQL string concatenation: untrusted input concatenated with raw SQL query can result in SQL Injection. In order to execute raw query safely, prepared statement should be used. SQLAlchemy provides TextualSQL to easily used prepared statement with named parameters. For complex SQL composition, use SQL Expression Language or Schema Definition Language. In most cases, SQLAlchemy ORM will be a better option.

- **python.django.security.injection.sql.sql-injection-using-db-cursor-execute.sql-injection-db-cursor-execute** in `/tmp/mcp_semgrep_tk_qkny0/repo/app_vuln.py`: User-controlled data from a request is passed to 'execute()'. This could lead to a SQL injection and therefore protected information could be leaked. Instead, use django's QuerySets, which are built with query parameterization and therefore not vulnerable to sql injection. For example, you could use `Entry.objects.filter(date=2006)`.

- **python.flask.security.audit.debug-enabled.debug-enabled** in `/tmp/mcp_semgrep_tk_qkny0/repo/app_vuln.py`: Detected Flask app with debug=True. Do not deploy to production with this flag enabled as it will leak sensitive information. Instead, consider using Flask configuration variables or setting 'debug' using system environment variables.

## LLM Remediation Proposal

Risk Summary:
The application has several security vulnerabilities related to SQL injection and template injection. These issues could potentially lead to data leakage, modification, or theft. Additionally, the debug flag is enabled, which could expose sensitive information to attackers.

Remediation Steps:
1. Use parameterized queries instead of manually constructing SQL strings. This can be achieved using Django's QuerySets or SQLAlchemy's ORM.
2. Avoid using string formatting to create templates. Instead, use a templating engine such as Jinja2 or Mako.
3. Disable the debug flag in production environments. This can be done by setting the 'debug' variable to False in the Flask configuration or by using system environment variables.
4. Regularly test the application for SQL injection and template injection vulnerabilities using tools such as SQLMap or Burp Suite.

Example Code/Patterns:

Parameterized Queries using Django's QuerySets:
```python
from django.db import connection
from django.db.models import F

def get_user_data(user_id):
    user = User.objects.get(id=
